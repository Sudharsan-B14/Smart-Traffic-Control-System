# 🚦 Smart Traffic Management System  

## 🚨 Problem Statement  
Traditional traffic management systems operate on **fixed signal timings**, leading to inefficiencies such as:  
- 🚗 **Unnecessary waiting times** even when a lane is empty.  
- 🚦 **Traffic congestion** due to rigid timing cycles.  
- 🚑 **Delayed emergency vehicle response** in critical situations.  
- 🌍 **Increased fuel consumption & pollution** due to idle vehicles.  

With growing urbanization, traffic congestion has become a major issue that requires **smart and adaptive** solutions.  

## 🏛 Traditional Traffic Control Systems  
Conventional traffic lights work on **predefined time intervals**, switching signals based on fixed cycles, regardless of real-time traffic conditions. These systems **lack adaptability** and cannot:  
- Adjust based on vehicle density.  
- Prioritize emergency vehicles dynamically.  
- Provide **real-time traffic optimization** for better flow control.  

## 💡 Smart Traffic Management System – Our Approach  
Our **AI-powered Smart Traffic Management System** overcomes these limitations by **dynamically adjusting traffic lights** based on real-time vehicle density.  

### 🔄 **How It Works?**  
1️⃣ **📷 Real-Time Traffic Input**  
   - Cameras in traffic lanes **capture live footage** of vehicles.  
   - The video feed is **sent to a cloud server** for processing.  

2️⃣ **☁ Cloud Processing & Algorithm**  
   - The server **analyzes vehicle density** and **counts vehicles** in each lane.  
   - It then **compares the traffic levels** and **determines the priority lane** using an AI-based algorithm.  

3️⃣ **📡 Data Transmission (MQTT Protocol)**  
   - The **processed traffic lane details** are sent from the cloud to the edge system via **MQTT**.  

4️⃣ **🖥 Edge System (ESP32 & ESP8266)**  
   - **ESP32**: **Modifies traffic signals** based on server instructions.  
   - **ESP8266**: **Triggers an alarm** to alert drivers in the selected lane.  

## 🛠 System Components  
### 📡 **Hardware Components**  
- **ESP32** – Controls traffic signals based on cloud data.  
- **ESP8266** – Generates an alarm for lane selection alerts.  
- **Camera** – Captures real-time traffic footage.  

### 🧑‍💻 **Software & Technologies**  
- **Python & OpenCV** – For image processing & vehicle detection.  
- **Google Colab (Cloud Server)** – Processes traffic data & selects the lane.  
- **MQTT Protocol** – For efficient communication between server & edge devices.  
- **ESP32 & ESP8266 Firmware** – Implements the traffic control logic.
